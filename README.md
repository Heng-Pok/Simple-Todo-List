# Simple-Todo-List
A Java computer app that allows users to create, save, and manipulate a to-do list. 

How to use:
- The src folder should contain all the necessary Java files to run the program.
- Place them in your Java project folder and run the ToDoListGUI on an IDE.
- It can be found in the "view" folder inside the "src" folder.
- The ToDoList.ser should act as a save file and should also be included in your project folder
- Make sure to also have JavaFX set up on your IDE to run it. You can search online for tutorials on how to do so.
